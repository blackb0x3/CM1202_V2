# CM1202_V2
Remastered Edition of a first year project from university.

AIM
To create a facility where students, lecturers, and system administrators
can easily search for and access university course information, including
modules, coursework, exams etc.

INSPIRATION
As part of a team of 5, we had to build a system that allowed students and
lecturers to set and view tests for topics of modules that students were
taking at university.
In my opinion, the end product wasn't delivered on the best platform, as I
thought it would perform as a web application which students and lecturers
could access from any device.
So in August 2016, I started implementing a new version of our program on
a web platform.

LANGUAGES
Back End : PHP, MySQL
Front End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery

EXTRA NOTES
This project is being completed in my spare time in order to improve my
web programming skills, and has therefore not yet been fully implemented.
