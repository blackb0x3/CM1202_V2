				<h3>The "Pascaline"</h3>
				<p>1642: Blaise Pascal</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
					<li>First mechanical machine to perform calculations.</li>
					<li>Works like a cars odometer, but the wheels are rotated manually.</li>
					<li>Higher wheel rotates by one when a lower dial position produces a carry.
						<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
							<li>Can do addition directly on the machine.</li>
							<li>Can do subtraction using an algorithm called "complements to 9".</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>The Difference Engine</h3>
				<p>1822: Charles Babbage (original idea by J.H. M&uu;mlller, 1786)</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
					<li>Evaluates Polynomials (e.g. trigonometric functions, logarithms etc.) using series expansion.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<br/>
			<div>
				<h3>The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator)</h3>
				<p>1943 - 1946</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
					<li>Operational in 1946.</li>
					<li>World's first fully electronic computer.</li>
					<li>300 multiplications or 5000 additions per second.</li>
					<li>Numerous components followed on from this device (e.g. transistors, vacuum tubes, crystal diodes etc.)</li>
					<li>Couldn't yet store digital programs in memory.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<br/>
			<div>
				<h3>The Small Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM)</h3>
				<p>1948: Tom Kilburn &amp; Freddie Williams</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
					<li>The world's first stored-program electronic computer.
						<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
							<li>Stored the values from calculations and program instructions in the same memory space.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>This was faster than ENIAC, since performing a different function required a reconfiguration of the electronic circuitry.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<br/>
			<div>
				<h3>Modern Computers</h3>
				<p>Contain a variety of new components compared to ENIAC and SSEM</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
					<li>Processor - Executes instructions and stores results in cache and RAM</li>
					<li>RAM (Random Access Memory) - Temporary storage device used to store values and instructions waiting to be executed by the processor.</li>
					<li>Hard Drive - Form of permanent data storage, used to store program files and data, such as those for a computer's operating system.</li>
					<li>BIOS - Performs a POST (Power On Self Test) on the computer to make sure that the components are functioning as they should. It also contains a program which attempts to locate a bootable operating system from the hard drive and loads this into the RAM.</li>
					<li>Expansion Cards - Used to add extra functionality to a computer; such as outputting images and sound or enabling network communications between other devices.</li>
					<li>Peripherals - Devices which can be connected to a computer using cables or wireless signals.
						<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
							<li>Inputs - Keyboard, Mouse, Microphone etc.</li>
							<li>Outputs - Monitor, Speakers, Printer</li>
							<li>Can you think of any devices that could be classed as both an input and output device?</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
